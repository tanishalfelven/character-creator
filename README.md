# character-creator

This is a simple mithril app that provides a skeleton for creating characters from sets of images. Not currently sure how far I'll go with it, but it isn't to difficult to keep running.

The point of this is to explore components in mithril, you can see in pretty much any `index.js` that all code has been kept pretty small by component-izing everything.
